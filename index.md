## Generative Music, NYU ITP, Fall 2018

### Description
--------

This 4 point course will go over the field of generative music, from its inception to the current state. The course will focus on both the history and technical implementation of generative music systems. We will work up from older practices (such as Markov chains) to the current intersection of music and machine learning, examining deep neural networks. 

This course aims to provide machine learning literacy as well as an overview of the various tools for generative music. Students will come out of the course with several small generative music projects of their own. This will be a primarily workshop-style course with a few lectures and guest speakers.

We will use p5.js/ml5.js as well as Python and command line tools.

Note: this is a 12-week class spread over the 14-week semester. There will be NO CLASS on Thursday, September 27th, and Thursday, November 1st.
