### Class Week 5

We'll go over the field of machine learning, learning vocabularly, types of ML algorithms, and examining architectures for generating music. We'll hear from a guest speaker as well.

### Assigment Week 5

1) Find an instance of bias in machine learning, and write a blog post about it. 

2) Read http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/

3) Begin thinking of a dataset you might want to create, either for music generation or lyric generation. No need to write about it, but bring your idea to class next week.
