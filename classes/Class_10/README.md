#### Assignment for next week:

Continue to explore these models (or a different one, if you're feeling ambitious). You can generate something from a pre-trained model, train your own model and generate from it, use Onsets and Frames to transcribe some pieces, or anything else as long as it involves one of the Magenta models. You'll show these in class next week (quick 3-4 minutes each).
