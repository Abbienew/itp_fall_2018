### Class Week 8

Today everyone will present their second music project! While in class, please ask a question about or comment on at least *two* other students' works.

### Assigment Week 8

Everyone will be assigned a model to research this week, which will be presented next class. The presentation should be about 8-10 minutes and can include: what the model does, the model's general type of architecture/architectures (i.e. CNN, RNN, VAE), the data it is trained on, the encoding, the year it is from, the organization/person/people who worked on it, the corresponding published paper if applicable, any relevant news articles on it, any available samples that can be played, if there is a repo/code available, where it is lacking/what are the next steps (if available), and any other relevant information. Don't worry about being too technical - the presentation should have an ELI5 feel.
