### Class Week 8

Today everyone will present their second music project! While in class, please ask a question about or comment on at least two other students' works.

### Assigment Week 8

Everyone will be assigned a model to research this week, which will be presented next class. The presentation should include what the model does, the model's general type of architecture/architectures (i.e. CNN, RNN, VAE), the data it is trained on, the year it is from (and corresponding paper if applicable), any available samples that can be played, and any other relevant information.
